# Assignment 1 - 35%
In the first practical each group (of 2 students) will choose an image dataset and examine the performance of different settings, such as:

*) Comparison of Deep architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception V-3, ResNet, etc.

*) Using dropout, batch normalization, weight decay, etc.

*) Using different activation functions such as ReLU, ELU, Leaky ReLU, PReLU, SoftPlus, Sigmoid, etc.

*) Using pre-trained networks, data augmentation

*) Using different optimizers such as SGD, SGD with momentum, Adam, RMSProp, Nadam, etc.


Each group can do as many comparison studies as they want and write a report with a short description and

tables / figures with results. The final report should be at most 3 pages in length. It is advised to not use a very large

dataset (e.g. > 200,000 examples), as this would cost too much computational time.

For your report, you need to use the style-file which can be downloaded from: https://bnaic2014.org/?page_id=49

The deadline for mailing your report to m.a.wiering@rug.nl and (a link to) your code is: **28 February 2020, 23.59h**

The report should consist of the following items: Title, student names + numbers, short intro, description of dataset, explanation of which methods you compared, results in a table (it is expected that there will be at least 8 different results), and a short discussion about the results.
